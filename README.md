# NWHacks23 : Eat Right
With Eat Right we aim to provide a personalised diet plan based on BodyMassIndex. It basically consist of 3 components :

## 1) User Specific Interface
A Webapplication which logs in and signs new user to Eat Right when they input their unique username and password.
Login for each user works using the fetch mechanism on Json.

## 2) Eat Right Portal and Health Constraints for Diet Recommendation
We can further find Body Mass Index for the user on the Eat Right Portal which could be further used by our Diet Recommendation model.
Body Mass Index for users are stored in our database.

## 3) Diet Recommendation
Using the Health Information provided by the user we can provide a personalised diet recommendation which would be beneficial for them to achieve their health goals
